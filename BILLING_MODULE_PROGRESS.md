## Known Issues

### 1. Strikethrough Detection ✅ RESOLVED (v5.0.0)
**Previous Issue**: Excel strikethrough formatting not detected by `xlsx` library
**Resolution**: Switched to ExcelJS with XML namespace preprocessing. Rich text character-level font data used to detect strikethrough. If >50% of non-whitespace characters are struck through, milestone is marked completed.
**Result**: 345 milestones auto-detected as completed from strikethrough formatting.

### 2. Data Source Reconciliation ✅ (Improved)
**Previous Issue**: ~40 projects showed mismatch between Excel and parsed fees
**Resolution**:
- Imported billing and collection data directly from parsed JSON
- Finance comments provide detailed transaction history
- Manual verification still recommended for critical decisions

**Remaining Considerations**:
- Multiple data sources may have minor discrepancies
- Finance comments should be primary source for verification
- Excel, JSON, and database should be cross-referenced for important transactions

### 3. Limited Bonus Detection
**Issue**: Only 1 bonus detected out of potentially more
**Cause**: Regex patterns don't cover all bonus formats
**Solution**: Add more regex patterns and review all fee arrangements manually

### 4. No Agreed Fee in Excel Column
**Note**: Excel "Fees (US$)" column needs to be populated
**Current**: Agreed fees calculated from parsed milestones
**Future**: Cross-validate with Excel column when available

### 5. Engagement Detail Fallback ✅ (Completed)
**Issue**: Billing Matter detail page showed milestone counts but the milestone table stayed empty when the engagement detail endpoint did not respond.
**Root Cause**: The frontend only called the `view=summary` variant of `GET /billing/projects/:id`, which omits embedded engagement + milestone data. Without that fallback the UI relied solely on the additional engagement detail fetch.
**Resolution**:
- Updated the client to request the `view=full` payload for the detail page, ensuring each C/M includes its engagements and milestones.
- Normalised embedded engagement IDs so the first valid engagement auto-selects and feeds the milestones card even if lazy-loaded requests fail.
**Result**: Milestone tables now render immediately for each C/M (e.g., project 1216) without requiring manual engagement selection or extra retries.

### 6. Milestone Management UX ✅ (Completed)
**What changed**:
- Simplified the C/M tabs and summary card (removed milestone tallies, trimmed copy, added UBT & Billing Credits, and streamlined status chips).
- Added inline editing for milestone reference text plus CRUD controls (add/edit/remove) for individual milestones, all wired to the existing billing APIs.
- Refreshed the milestones table with action icons while keeping the detail panel responsive to engagement selection.
**Result**: Users can maintain milestones directly from the billing detail page without leaving the flow or relying on backend scripts.

```typescript
// Chinese USD: "不低于10万美元奖金"
/(?:不低于)?(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)万美元奖金/

// Chinese CNY: "不低于10万人民币奖金"
/(?:不低于)?(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)万(?:人民币|元)奖金/

// English: "bonus of $100,000"
/bonus[:\s]+\$\s*([\d,]+)/i
```
