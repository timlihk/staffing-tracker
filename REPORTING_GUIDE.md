## Technical Details

### Backend Architecture

**Dependencies**:
- `zod` - Schema validation
- `exceljs` - Excel file generation
- `dayjs` - Date manipulation

**Files**:
- `backend/src/types/reports.types.ts` - TypeScript types and Zod schemas
- `backend/src/services/reports.service.ts` - Data fetching logic with Prisma
- `backend/src/services/reports.excel.ts` - Excel workbook generation
- `backend/src/controllers/reports.controller.ts` - Request handlers
- `backend/src/routes/reports.routes.ts` - Route definitions

### Frontend Architecture

**Dependencies**:
- `@mui/x-data-grid` - Interactive data table
- `@mui/x-date-pickers` - Date range selection
- `dayjs` - Date formatting
- `file-saver` - File download handling

**Files**:
- `frontend/src/pages/Reports.tsx` - Main report builder component
- `frontend/src/styles/print.css` - Print-specific styling

### Performance Considerations

- **Query Limit**: Backend limits to 10,000 assignments per query
- **Pagination**: Frontend DataGrid supports pagination (25/50/100/200 per page)
- **Indexing**: Database indexes on projectId, staffId for fast filtering
- **Caching**: Consider browser caching for frequently used filters

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with broader filters and refine as needed
2. **Use Date Ranges**: Limit results by date for faster loading
3. **Export Regularly**: Download Excel reports for offline analysis
4. **Print Preview**: Always preview before printing to verify layout

### For Administrators

1. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for slow queries with many filters
2. **Data Quality**: Ensure project and staff data is complete for accurate reports
3. **Regular Exports**: Encourage monthly Excel exports for record-keeping
4. **Training**: Train users on effective filter combinations

## Troubleshooting

### Report Not Loading

- Check internet connection
- Verify authentication (log out and log back in)
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors

### Excel Export Fails

- Ensure pop-up blocker is disabled
- Check available disk space
- Verify browser supports file downloads
- Try different browser if issue persists

### Print Layout Issues

- Use landscape orientation
- Adjust print scale if needed (90-95% often works best)
- Ensure "Print backgrounds" is enabled in browser settings
- Consider using "Save as PDF" for consistent results

### Missing Data

- Verify filters are not too restrictive
- Check date range includes expected assignments
- Ensure projects/staff have proper category/role assignments
- Contact administrator if data appears incorrect
