2. Deploy to Railway.app
3. Import Excel data
4. Use API directly (Postman, etc.)

**Benefit:** Backend is live, can be tested, data is migrated

### Option B: Complete Frontend First
**Time: 6 hours**

1. Build React components (I can help with this!)
2. Test locally with backend
3. Deploy both simultaneously

**Benefit:** Full application ready to go

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
**Time: 1 hour + ongoing**

1. Deploy backend now (30 min)
2. Build frontend incrementally (30 min per feature)
3. Deploy frontend as features complete

**Benefit:** Backend live immediately, frontend rolls out progressively

## 🎓 How to Continue

### If you want to deploy backend now:

```bash
# Initialize git
cd /home/timlihk/staffing-tracker
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Backend complete, frontend in progress"

# Push to GitHub (create repo first)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/staffing-tracker.git
git push -u origin main

# Then follow DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for Railway setup
```

### If you want to complete frontend first:

I can help you build the frontend components! Just let me know and I'll create:
1. Login page
2. Dashboard with charts
3. Project management pages
4. Staff management pages
5. All necessary UI components

### If you want to customize:
