2. Deploy to Railway.app
3. Import Excel data
4. Use API directly (Postman, etc.)

**Benefit:** Backend is live, can be tested, data is migrated

### Option B: Complete Frontend First
**Time: 6 hours**

1. Build React components (I can help with this!)
2. Test locally with backend
3. Deploy both simultaneously

**Benefit:** Full application ready to go

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
**Time: 1 hour + ongoing**

1. Deploy backend now (30 min)
2. Build frontend incrementally (30 min per feature)
3. Deploy frontend as features complete

**Benefit:** Backend live immediately, frontend rolls out progressively

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/staffing-tracker.git
git push -u origin main

# Then follow DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for Railway setup
```
